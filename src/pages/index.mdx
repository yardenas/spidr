## Abstract

This is a live demo for a template you can use to create a simple project page for your research paper. See the code for the template and instructions on how to use it yourself [here](https://github.com/RomanHauksson/academic-project-astro-template). It's made with the [Astro web framework](https://astro.build/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). You write the content in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which enables markdown formatting like **bold** and _italics_ as well as custom components like <SmallCaps>small caps.</SmallCaps>

## Another section, with a figure

Use the figure component to display images, videos, equations, or any other element, with an optional caption.

<Figure
    caption="Diagram of the transformer deep learning architecture."
  >
    <Image src={transformer} alt="alt text" />
</Figure>

## Two columns

Use the two columns component to display two columns of content. In this example, the first column contains a figure with a YouTube video and the second column contains a figure with a custom [React](https://react.dev/) component. By default, they display side by side, but if the screen is narrow enough (for example, on mobile), they're arranged vertically.

<TwoColumns>
  <Figure slot="left" caption="Take a look at this YouTube video.">
    <YouTubeVideo videoId="wjZofJX0v4M" />
  </Figure>
  <Figure slot="right" caption="Now look at this Gaussian Splat, rendered with a React component.">
    <Splat client:idle />
  </Figure>
</TwoColumns>

## LaTeX

You can also add LaTeX formulas, rendered during the build process using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) so they're quick to load for visitors of your project page. You can write them inline, like this: <LaTeX inline formula="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" />. Or, you can write them as a block:

<LaTeX formula="\int_a^b f(x) dx" />
